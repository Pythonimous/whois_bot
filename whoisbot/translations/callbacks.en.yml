    ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Welcome, %{username}! Let's get to know each other â˜º
    Before chatting here, you'll need to tell me about yourself.
    For that, message me (@who_ru_bot) <code>/start</code> (you have 24h; after that, you will be banned for 3 days)
    P.S. If you haven't set the language yet, you might have to write <code>/start</code> twice :)
